# Gear Autoselector (beta)

If you're like me you ride different bikes in different situations. It's annoying that Strava can't just read my mind as to which bike I rode for a given activity.  Leaving me to go in to the activity manually and switch the bike.


This app works by looking at some of your manually classified routes and weighting segments done on them.  The idea is if you've only done most of a ride on a mountain bike previously the end ride is classified as a mountain bike.


## Feature requests

* An interface that allows users to reclassify rides
* An interface that allows users to select a bike to replace a previous bike 
* Support for new bike day.  Currently rides will be reclassified to the bike the most often rode on those segements.
* Support for other gear/activity types.  (currently scoped to just bike rides)
